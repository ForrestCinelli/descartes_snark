This is a Dominions 6 Map. 

To use it in your game: run build.sh and copy the resulting DescartesSnark folder to Dominions6/maps/

If you must build on Windows without Git Bash, Cygwin, or WSL, just run the python script and assemble the folder yourself: it should contain a copy of DescartesSnark.map and all the newly generated .tga files.
